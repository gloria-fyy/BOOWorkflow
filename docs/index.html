        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
        The workflow patterns research work led by Wil van der Aalst and Arthur ter Hofstede result in the identification of 43 patterns that describe the behavior of business processes. The results can be used as a basis to examine the strengths and weaknesses of a particular language to process specification. This technical documentation provides a comprehensive evaluationof the business object-oriented process modeling approach such that how the workflow patterns can be represented by this approach.

        <h3>1	Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        The research work led by Wil van der Aalst and Arthur ter Hofstede result in the iden-tification of 43 patterns that describe the behavior of business processes [1]. The aim of this research is to evaluate the expressiveness of various approaches to process specification used as a basis for language and tool development.  The original twenty patterns along with the twenty three new patterns form the new collection of work-flow patterns associated with the control-flow perspective. The collection divides into eight classes of patterns namely basic control flow patterns, advanced branching and synchronization patterns, multiple instance patterns, state-based patterns, cancella-tion and force completion patterns, iteration patterns, termination patterns and  trig-ger patterns. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper reviews how the business object-oriented process modeling approach can represent the workflow patterns from the control-flow perspective. We should assume at the beginning that the business process has only one business object with no interaction with other business objects, since workflow patterns associated with the control-flow perspective do not describe the interaction between processes. Since we have extended statecharts with actions and events to model the life cycle of the business object, the evaluation of a process specification with a single business object is equivalent to the evaluation of extended statecharts.

        <h3>2	Basic Control Patterns</h3>
		<p>
        The first five patterns capture basic aspects of process behavior. 
        <h4>2.1	Sequence</h4>
        The sequence pattern describes activities which are executed one after the other in sequential routing. The business object-oriented modeling approach uses states with a given order to describe this pattern as shown in Fig. 1. E1 is the event generated after the completion of the task in State1. C1 is the condition of the transition. A1 is the action of the transition. The business object stays in State1 until E1 occurs and C1 is true, at that time the transition from State1 to State2 is triggered. Then the task in State2 is executed. Note that the task is invoked on the entry action of a state.

        <br>
        <h4>2.2	Parallel Split</h4>
        The parallel split pattern describes the split of a branch into two or more branches so that multiple activities can be executed concurrently. Figure 2 shows the parallel split pattern. We do not specify the ECA rules on the transition, since by default, the events are the completion of tasks in the source states. The exit condition of the par-allel state is the completion of all the concurrent branches.

        <br>
        <h4>2.3	Synchronization</h4>
        The synchronization pattern describes the convergence of two or more concurrent branches that are created using the parallel split pattern. By default, the exit condi-tion of the parallel state StateP is the completion of all its concurrent branches. As shown in Fig.3, the synchronization is happened when both the tasks in State2 and State3 are completed.

        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>2.4	Exclusive Choice</h4>
        The exclusive choice pattern describes the ability to choose one activity from several alternative branches based on a mechanism. As shown in Fig.4, which transition is triggered is depend on the condition on the transition.

        <br>
        <h4>2.5	Simple Merge</h4>
        The simple merge pattern is used to merge the alternative branches chosen in the exclusive choice pattern into a single branch. It differs from the synchronization pat-tern in that merging several branches without synchronizing them. The diagram is shown in Fig.5.

        <h3>3	Advanced Branching and Synchronization Patterns</h3>
        <p>
        This series of patterns characterize advanced and complex concepts of branching and merging the flow of a business process. 
        <h4>3.1	Multi-Choice</h4>
        The multi-choice pattern describes the divergence of a branch into one or more paral-lel branches based on a selection mechanism. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach provides a way to support the multi-choice pattern as shown in Fig.6. The Null state behind the initial pseudo-state in each branch of the parallel state is the key point to implement this pattern. In state Null the business object does nothing but waits for an event (e1/e2). The action of the transition from stateA to MC means that sends e1 or e2 or both of them to the pro-cess model. When an event is sent, the variable sCount is increased by one. If e1 is sent, then e1 is handled by the first branch of the parallel state such that the transi-tion from Null to State1 is triggered. The task in State1 is executed when entering State1. The variable fCount is increased by one when the task in State1 is completed. Note that the second branch stays in the Null state all the time since there is no e2 in the event queue. If both e1 and e2 are sent, then both of the parallel branches are selected. Therefore, as shown in Fig.2, any of the branches can be selected.
        <br><br>
        <h4>3.2	Structured Synchronizing Merge</h4>
        The structured synchronizing merge pattern is used to merge the parallel branches selected in the multi-choice pattern that must be associated with the multi-choice pattern in the process model. The modeling challenge is that the number of parallel branches to be merged is not known at the design time. It is totally depend on the multi-choice pattern.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the description of multi-choice pattern, we can see that there are two varia-bles that need to pay attention to. The variable sCount will be increased by one when an event is generated by the action of the transition from StateA to MC. The variable fCount will be increased by one when a branch is completed. Therefore the synchro-nization of results is executed when the two variables become equal. Then the transi-tion from MC to StateB is triggered. Thus, as shown in Fig.7, any of the branches can be selected and synchronized.
        <div class="centered">

            <img src="assets/img/fig7.png">
            <h5>Fig. 7.Structured synchronizing merge pattern</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>3.3	Multi-Merge</h4>
        The multi-merge pattern provides a means of merging multiple distinct branches into a single subsequent branch. It differs from the structured synchronization pattern in that there is no need to synchronize these branches when they are completed and the completion of each branch will instantiate the tasks in the subsequent branch one time. The multi-merge pattern must be associated with the multi-choice pattern which is appeared earlier in the process model.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually this pattern is a little bit confused to me about the behavior of duplicate execution. Such duplicate execution of the subsequent tasks is not supported in the business object-oriented modeling approach. For statecharts, if a parallel branch is completed, it will wait for the completion of all the other branches before the pro-cessing of subsequent branches. Therefore the exit condition of the parallel state is the completion of all the parallel branches. While if there are additional guard condi-tions, the exit condition is the conjunction of the additional conditions and the com-pletion of all the parallel branches. For the multi-merge pattern, if one branch is com-pleted and immediately exited from the parallel state, all the remaining branches are ignored or cancelled. The completion of those remaining branches cannot generate any event or trigger any transition and instantiate the tasks in the subsequent branch again, since the current state is not that parallel state. Actually we do support the synchronization and merge of any number of parallel branches, but do not support the duplicate instantiation of subsequent tasks after the multi-merge.
        <br><br>
        <h4>3.4	Structured Discriminator</h4>
        The structured discriminator is a location in a process model which is used to pass the control-flow to the subsequent branch when the first parallel branch triggered from the and-split structure is completed. The structured discriminator pattern differs from the multi-merge pattern in that the completions of other parallel branches are ignored and do not trigger the second execution of subsequent tasks. The structured discrimi-nator is reset when all the triggered parallel branches complete. The structured dis-criminator pattern must be associated with the parallel state. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern by means of triggering the transition from the parallel state SD to the target state StateB when the first parallel branch is completed and ignore the task instances in the remaining parallel branches (see Fig.8). One point in the business object-oriented modeling ap-proach that is different from this pattern is that the remaining tasks in the remaining parallel branches are all canceled instead of letting them execute until completed, since leaving a state means the task in that state is disabled and cannot be executed. So actually we cannot totally support this pattern.
        <div class="centered">
            <img src="assets/img/fig8.png">
            <h5>Fig. 8.Structured discriminator pattern</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>3.5	Blocking Discriminator</h4>
        The blocking discriminator is a variant of the structured discriminator which is used when there are concurrent execution instances of the same process model in the envi-ronment. The blocking discriminator passes the control-flow to the subsequent branch when the first parallel branch triggered from the and-split construct is com-pleted. The blocking discriminator is reset when all triggered parallel branches are completed. Other process instances cannot pass the control-flow to the and-split structure until the blocking discriminator is reset and the preceding instance of the task in the subsequent branch has been completed.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern by means of triggering the transition from the parallel state SD to the target state StateB when the first parallel branch is completed and ignore the task instances in the remaining parallel branches (see Fig.9). Each task instance in the remaining parallel branches is cacelled. Assume there are two instances of the same process model named A1 and A2. A2 won’t trigger the transition to the parallel state BD until all the parallel branches in A1 have been completed and A1 has leaved stateB to other states.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point in the business object-oriented modeling approach that is different from this pattern is that the remaining tasks in the remaining parallel branches are all can-celed instead of letting them execute until completed, since leaving a state means the task in that state is disabled and cannot be executed. So actually we cannot totally support this pattern.

            <h5>Fig. 9.Blocking discriminator pattern</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>3.6	Cancelling Discriminator</h4>
        The cancelling discriminator is used to pass the control-flow to the subsequent branch when the first parallel branch triggered from the and-split construct is completed and also cancel the execution of the tasks in the other parallel branches. Note that only the first completed branch is important.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach supports this pattern by means that withdraw the task instances in the uncompleted branches.

            <h5>Fig. 10.Cancelling discriminator pattern</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>3.7	Structured Partial Join</h4>
        The structured partial join pattern provides a means of merging two or more parallel branches (say m) into a single branch where m is less that the number of parallel branches. The completions of the remaining parallel branches (say n-m) do not result in the execution of the subsequent tasks.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach uses a variable fCount to record the completion of a parallel branch. As shown in Fig.11, when fCount equals to the specific number, here is two, the transition from the parallel state SPJ to StateB is triggered. One point should be noticed is that in the business object-oriented modeling approach, the remaining tasks in the remaining parallel branches are all canceled instead of letting them execute until completed, since leaving a state means the task in that state is disabled and cannot be executed. So actually we cannot totally sup-port this pattern.

        <br>
        <h4>3.8	Blocking Partial Join</h4>
        The blocking partial join pattern is the variant of the structured partial pattern which is used when there are concurrent execution instances of the same process model in the environment. It is the combination of the blocking discriminator pattern and the structured partial join pattern. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot totally support this pattern as the same reason we have announced in the above.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>3.9	Cancelling Partial Join</h4>
        The cancelling partial join pattern merges two or more parallel branches (say m) into a single branch where m is less that the number of parallel branches (say n). The merge of these m branches also cancel the execution of the remaining parallel branches (say n-m).
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach uses a variable fCount to record the completion of a parallel branch. As shown in Fig.13, when fCount equals to the specific number, here is two, the transition from the parallel state SPJ to StateB is triggered. Meanwhile, other tasks are cancelled.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the business object-oriented modeling approach supports the cancela-tion and retention of the remaining parallel branches.

        <h3>4	Multiple Instance Patterns</h3>
        <p>
        This series of patterns describe multiple instances of the same task are created in a business process based on different situations. 
        <h4>4.1	Multiple Instances without Synchronization</h4>
        This pattern describes situation in which multiple instances of a given task can be created and the number of instances is known before the task is executed. These instances are independent of each other and run concurrently within the context of the process instance. There is no need to synchronize them when they are completed. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach supports this pattern as shown in Fig.14. When entering State2, the task in the entry action will be executed. The re-quired number of the instances is obtained from the parameters of the event generated by the completion of the task in State1.

            <h5>Fig. 14.Multiple instances without synchronization pattern</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>4.2	Multiple Instances with a Priori Design-Time Knowledge</h4>
        This pattern describes a situation in which multiple instances of a given task can be created and the number of instances is known at design time. These instances are independent of each other and run concurrently. The completions of the task in-stances must be synchronized before the processing of the subsequent branch.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach supports this pattern as shown in Fig.15 When entering State2, the task in the entry action will be executed. The re-quired number of the instances is given in the business data at design time. We use a variable fCount to count for the completion of each task instance. When the value of fCount is equal to the number of the instance, the synchronization is executed and the transition to State3 is triggered.
        <div class="centered">
            <img src="assets/img/fig15.png">
            <h5>Fig. 15.Multiple instances with a priori design-time ksowledge</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>4.3	Multi Instances with a Priori Run-Time Knowledge</h4>
        This pattern describes a situation in which multiple instances of a given task can be created and the number of instances is known during run time, but before the first of the task is executed. These instances are independent of each other and run concur-rently. The completions of the task instances must be synchronized before the processing of the subsequent branch.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern as shown in Fig.16. When entering State2, the task in the entry action will be executed. The re-quired number of the instances is obtained from the parameters of the event generated by the completion of the task in State1. We use a variable fCount to count for the completion of each task instance. When the value of fCount is equal to the number of the instance, the synchronization is executed and the transition to Ssate3 is triggered.

        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>4.4	Multiple Instances without a Priori Run-Time Knowledge</h4>
        This pattern describes a situation in which multiple instances of a given task can be created. The required number of instances may depend on a number of runtime fac-tors and cannot be determined until the last instance of that task is completed. At any time, whilst multiple instances are running, it is possible for additional instances of the same task to be created.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach utilizes the combination of exter-nal events and internal transitions to implement this pattern. As shown in Fig.17, when entering State2, the instances of UserTask2 are created. The required number of the instances depends on a number of runtime factors. For example, the number may be the parameters of the event generated by the completion of the task in State1.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in State2, if the user sends an event named newInstance from the external system, an internal transition is triggered and an additional instance is created. Meanwhile, the variable num is increased by one. When a task instance is completed, an event named complete is generated and the internal transition is triggered. The action on this transition is to increase the variable fCount by one. When the value of fCount is equal to the number of the instances which are actually created, the synchronization is executed and the transition to State3is triggered. 
        <div class="centered">
            <img src="assets/img/fig17.png">
            <h5>Fig. 17.Multi instances without a priori run-time knowledge</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>4.5	Static Partial Join for Multiple Instances</h4>
        This pattern describes a situation in which multiple instances of a given task can be created and the number of instances is known during run time, but before the first of the task is executed. These instances are independent of each other and run concurrently. Once a specific number task instances have been completed, the next task is triggered. Subsequent completions of the remaining instances are inconsequential. However all instances must have been completed in order for the join construct to reset and be subsequently re-enabled.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern as shown in Fig.18. When entering State2, the task in the entry action will be executed. The required number of the instances is obtained from the parameters of the event generated by the completion of the task in State1. We use a variable fCount to count for the completion of each task instance. When the value of fCount is equal to the number of the instance, the synchronization is executed and the transition to State3 is triggered. Other task instances of UserTask2 will be cancelled. One point in the business object-oriented modeling approach that is different from this pattern is that the remaining task instances are all canceled instead of letting them execute until completed, since leaving a state means the task in that state is disabled and cannot be executed.
        <div class="centered">

            <h5>Fig. 18.Static partial join for multiple instances</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>4.6	Cancelling Partial Join for Multiple Instances</h4>
        This pattern describes a situation in which multiple instances of a given task can be created and the number of instances is known during run time, but before the first of the task is executed. These instances are independent of each other and run concur-rently. Once a specific number of the task instances have been completed, the next task is triggered. This pattern differs from the static partial join for multiple instances pattern in that the remaining instances are cancelled.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the business object-modeling approach only supports the cancellation of remaining task instances, the description of this pattern in the business object-oriented modeling approach is the same as the static partial join for multiple instanc-es pattern.

        <br>
        <h4>4.7	Dynamic Partial Join for Multiple Instances</h4>
        This pattern describes a situation in which multiple instances of a given task can be created. The required number of instances may depend on a number of runtime fac-tors and cannot be determined until the last instance of that task is completed. At any time, whilst multiple instances are running, it is possible for additional instances of the same task to be created. A completion condition is specified which is evaluated each time a task instance is completed. Once the completion condition evaluates to true, the next task in the process is triggered. Subsequent completions of the remain-ing task instances are inconsequential and no new instances can be created.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach utilizes the combination of exter-nal events and internal transitions to implement this pattern. As shown in Fig.20, when entering State2, the instances of UserTask2 are created. The required number of the instances depends on a number of runtime factors. For example, the number may be the parameters of the event generated by the completion of the task in State1. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in State2, if the user sends an event named newInstance from the external system, an internal transition is triggered and an additional instance is created. Meanwhile, the variable num is increased by one. When a task instance is completed, an event named complete is generated and the internal transition is triggered. The action on this transition is to increase the variable fCount by one and send an event E. The condition of the transition from State2 to State3 is evaluated each time a task instance is completed. When it becomes true, the synchronization is executed and the transition to State3is triggered. One point in the business object-oriented modeling approach that is different from this pattern is that the remaining task instances are all canceled instead of letting them execute until completed, since leaving a state means the task in that state is disabled and cannot be executed.

        <h3>5	State-based Patterns</h3>
        <p>
        This series of patterns describe how the behavior of a business process may be affected by factors from external environment. Since the business object-oriented modeling approach is based on statecharts which is event-driven and state-based, all the five patterns in this class are supported. 
        <h4>5.1	Deferred Choice</h4>
        The deferred choice pattern is similar to the exclusive choice pattern that only chooses one path from the alternative paths. However, the choice mechanism is different. The deferred choice pattern is based on interaction with the external environment. When the process instance receives an event from the external environment, the decision is made and other alternative paths are withdrawn.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern by generat-ing an event from the external systems, such as an event sent by the user, timeout event, environment data etc. When an event is received, the proper transition is triggered and other alternative states won’t be entered.

        <h4>5.2	Interleaved Parallel Routing</h4>
        This pattern describes a set of tasks that must be executed with respect to their partial ordering. Although there is a word “parallel” in the name of this pattern, tasks in that set must be executed in a sequential order and it is not possible to initiate one task during the execution of another task.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in Fig.20, there is a Null state between the sub states in each parallel branch which is used to wait for events to be occurred.  When the transition from StateA to IPR is triggered by event complete_TaskA, an event is sent from the set {e1, e2, e3, e4} randomly depend on the external environment and the current state of the process model. When entering IPR, if e1 is chosen, the first parallel branch is triggered by e1 and moves to State1. While Task1 is being executed, the other two branches stay in Null waiting for e2 or e3 to be sent. When Task1 is completed, the transition from State1 to the Final state is triggered and an event from the set {e1, e2, e3, e4} is sent randomly depend on the external environment and the current state of other parallel branches. Here if e2 is chosen to be sent, when the second branch takes the transition from State2 to Null, an event from the set {e1, e2, e3, e4} is sent ran-domly depend on the external environment and the current state of other parallel branches. Here only e3 or e4 can be generated since the first parallel branch has ar-rived at its final state and the third branch is still in the Null state. The transition from the concurrent state to StateB is triggered when all the parallel branches are at their Final states.

        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>5.3	Milestone</h4>
        The description of the milestone pattern is that the task is executed only when the process instance is in a specific state (typically a parallel branch). The state is as-sumed to be a specific execution point (also known as a milestone) in the process model. If the process instance has progressed beyond this state, then the task cannot be executed now or at any future time.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern by the test condition in (somestate) within a concurrent state, which means that if some parallel branch is in a specific state, the nominate transition in another parallel branch is trig-gered. As shown in Fig.21, the transition from State2 to State3 is triggered only when the current state of the concurrent state StateP is State3. In other words, the task in State4 is executed only when the first parallel branch is in State3.

        <br>
        <h4>5.4	Critical Section</h4>
        The description of critical section pattern is that limits the concurrent execution of two or more critical sections of a process. Once the tasks in one "critical section" start to execute, it must complete before another "critical section" can start to execute.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach implements this pattern as shown in Fig.22. When the transition from StateA to StateCS is triggered, an event from the set {e1, e2} is sent to the process model. Therefore only one parallel branch will be processed and another parallel branch waits for the trigger event. If the top parallel branch is executed first, it will send e2 when it moves to the Final state. At this time the branch below the first branch starts processing. When it completes, it will send e1. Note that e1 is ignored since at this time the above parallel branch is at its Final state.

        <br>
        <h4>5.5	Interleaved Routing</h4>
        The interleaved routing pattern allows a set of tasks to be executed in any order but no two tasks can be executed at the same time. The next task in the process can be executed after each task in this set has been executed once.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in Fig.23, there is a Null state behind the initial state in each parallel branch which is used to wait for events to be occurred. When the transition from Sta-teA to IR is triggered by event complete_TaskA, an event is sent from the set {e1, e2, e3, e4} randomly. When entering IR, if e1 is chosen, the first parallel branch is trig-gered by e1 and moves to State1. While Task1 is being executed, the other two branches stay in Null waiting for e2 or e3 to be sent. When Task1 is completed, the transition from State1 to the Final state is triggered and an event from the set {e2, e3} is sent randomly depend on the current state of other parallel branches. Here if e2 is chosen to be sent, when the second branch takes the transition from State2 to the Final state, an event from the set {e1, e3} is sent randomly depend on the current state of other parallel branches. Here only e3 can be generated since the first parallel branch has arrived at its final state. The transition from the concurrent state to StateB is triggered when all the parallel branches are completed.

        <h3>6	Cancellation and Force Completion Patterns</h3>
        <p>
        Several of the patterns above have variants that utilize the concept of activity can-cellation where task instances are withdrawn. Various forms of exception handling in processes are also based on cancellation concepts. This series of patterns describe five cancellation patterns.
        <h4>6.1	Cancel Task</h4>
        The cancel task pattern describes the ability to withdraw a task which has been ena-bled or is already executing.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern as shown in Fig.26. The transition from State2 to State3 or State4 is a race relationship between the cancelTask event and the completion of the task instance.

            <h5>Fig. 26.Cancel task pattern</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>6.2	Cancel Case</h4>
        This pattern is an extension of the cancel task pattern that an entire process instance is removed. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern as shown in Fig.27. Each state has a transition to the Final state triggered by the cancelCase event. When a cancelCase event is generated, no matter which state the process in-stance is in, the process instance will be completed immediately.

        <br>
        <h4>6.3	Cancel Region</h4>
        The cancel region pattern describes cancelling a set of tasks in a process instance. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern as shown in Fig.28. When a cancel event is generated and the process instance is in State3 or State4 or State5, the transition from State2 to State8 is triggered by the cancel event and all the executing task instances or enabling tasks in these states are withdrawn.

        <br>
        <h4>6.4	Cancel Multiple Instance Task</h4>
        This pattern provides a means of cancelling a multiple instance task at any time dur-ing its execution such that any remaining instances are cancelled. Task instances that have already completed are unaffected by the cancellation.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern as shown in Fig.29. In State2, 500 instances of UserTask2 are created and assigned to users. If the task is not completed before the given time or some other exception occurs during executing, the cancelTask event is generated. The transition from State2 to State4 is triggered to the cancelTask event and all the remaining task instances are withdrawn.

        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>6.5	Complete Multiple Instance Task</h4>
        This pattern provides a means of forcibly completing a multiple instance task at any time during its execution such that any remaining task instances are cancelled and the thread of control is passed to subsequent tasks.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business object-oriented modeling approach describes this pattern as shown in Fig.30. In State2, 500 instances of UserTask2 are created and assigned to users. If the task is not completed after an hour, the transition from State2 to State3 is triggered and the task in State3 is executed.
